// Transdimensional Vaporizer Ray
3156|This is a highly advanced alien device with one purpose: it can fire right through solid matter to vaporize background blocks without doing any harm to the foreground blocks. It uses alien batteries which we can't replace, so each Vaporizer can only be used once.

// Carnival Pinwheel
3158|Enjoy the beauty of this spinny pinwheel.

// Sword And Shield
3160|This is a classic warrior's combo - a nice cutlass for your main hand, and a shield in the other. The shield makes you harder to knock back!

// Twin Swords
3162|Why waste time with a shield? Just get two swords!

// Preppy Blonde Hair
3164|I think you've got just enough gel in there to go to the sock hop with Buffy!

// Pet Slime
3166|Nothing cuter than a sentient ball of slime that follows you around!

// Strawberry Slime
3168|So much tastier than the mucus flavor!

// Angry Unicorn Block
3170|This block is angry, and prominently features a unicorn.

// Legal Briefs
3172|Not only are these comfortable undergarments for everyday use, they also have a legal use: put them on when you are in trouble for Malpractice, and you'll be freed from your punishment! This uses up the briefs.

// Ring Of Smithing
3174|To be honest, this ring doesn't really do anything. Well, that is unless you want to smith something. Then you're definitely gonna need to wear this!

// Anvil
3176|You can forge astounding weapons on this, if it's next to a Forge that's been heated to 1,000 degrees, and you have Smithing Tools, and wear a Ring of Smithing and a Blacksmith's Apron. Oh, and have some item you want to smith. If you've got all that, go ahead and use the item on the anvil!

// Blacksmith's Apron
3178|This apron is made of heavy leather, making it very effective for protecting you from stray sparks when forging things.

// Crystal Smithing Tools
3180|These are the perfect tools for doing blacksmithing work... provided you don't mind the fact that crystal tools shatter when used.

// Blade Fragment
3182|This is a broken piece of a sword blade. It's of a low-quality steel and could stand to be tempered.

// Shield Fragment
3184|This is a broken piece of a shield. If you had enough of these, you could probably forge them into a new shield!

// Tempered Steel Fragment
3186|This is a beautiful tempered steel fragment of a sword blade. If you had enough of these, you could probably forge them into a new sword blade!

// Sword Pommel
3188|This is a lovingly crafted sword pommel. If only there were a blade to attach it to!

// Sword Blade
3190|This is a lovingly crafted sword blade. If only there were a pommel to attach it to!

// Warrior's Shield
3192|This is a lovingly crafted shield. But you can't punch blocks with a shield. Maybe you can combine this with a weapon to make a complete set?

// Forge
3194|You can use this to forge astounding weapons, if you have an Anvil next to it. You'll also need to fuel it with something really hot.

// Nuclear Fuel
3196|You can feel your cells mutating just being near this lump of radioactive garbage. About the only thing this is good for is firing up a forge to ridiculous levels of heat.

// Gift of the Unicorn
3198|The unicorn has gifted you great wisdom! The wisdom is thus: If you stick this wisdom, 2 Sword Pommels, and 2 Sword Blades, into a Laboratory and SCIENCE them... well, let's just say it'll be super cool.

// Giving Tree
3200|"Borrowed" from the Growch's private reserve, this magnificent tree will give you a gift every 4 hours for the duration of Winterfest!

// Giving Tree Stump
3202|This will regrow into a Giving Tree in a while.

// Tree Decorations
3204|All sorts of baubles and gewgaws to adorn your Giving Tree in true Winterfest style! One decoration won't do much, but you can toss up to 100 decorations on each tree! More decorations will logically result in better gifts, but taking the gift will remove all the decorations with it!

// Lumber Axe
3206|This axe is precisely balanced to chop down trees in just a single hit! Now, you might not be impressed since you can do that with your bare hands already. But wait - this axe can chop down the GROWCH'S trees! Of course, doing that will shatter it. They're very special trees.

// Axe Fragment
3208|This is a broken piece of an axe blade. It's not very high quality, perhaps it could be tempered.

// Icy Heart Of Winter
3210|You've found the Growch's icy heart! No wonder he's so mean - it's not even in his body! That's a major medical problem that would upset anyone.

// Icy Heart Pickup
3212|Players pick up an Icy Heart of Winter by touching this.

// Axe Of Winter
3214|Mittens are recommended when wielding this icy monstrosity, which does extra damage to blocks.

// Moose Cap
3216|This beautifully styled hat, suitable for all formal occasions, has the unique property of attracting wild meese to follow you around.

// Candy Cane Bait
3218|This is bait for fishing. Equip a fishing rod and then use this bait on water that you are standing next to in order to start fishing. This is the only bait that is its own hook! It catches unique seasonal fish that other bait doesn't appeal to.

// Neon Squid
3220|This squid glows in neon colors! What a fine holiday gift it would make.

// Antarctic Icefish
3222|These fish have the ability to survive in antarctic waters because they actually have antifreeze in their blood! It's science, google it.

// Gingerbread Fish
3224|You know how you can dunk cookies in milk? This one was dunked in the ocean. Kinda gross.

// Swedish Fish
3226|This breed of fish is unique to the waters of Sweden, and it has a surprisingly sweet taste when eaten raw. Don't eat yours though, it's a pet.

// Snowcone
3228|Yum, fruit flavors poured into ice! At least it's yum until all the flavoring gets sucked out.

// Toboggan
3230|This sled was called "Onion Bulb" by its original owner, but you can call it whatever you want. It comes with a free purple blanket to keep your legs warm!

// Winter Wind
3232|Place this anywhere you want the wind to come ripping through and push players around! The wind blows in the direction that you would blow air when placing it, so you can place it either way.

// Snowflake Block
3234|Just one exceptionally large snowflake, perfectly preserved in lucite. I don't know how they did it, but it's nice and slippery!

// Winter Robe
3236|Be the King of Winter in this luxurious satiny robe! Note: this is a "chest item", like a necklace, so you can wear any shirts and back items you want underneath it.

// Magical Carrot
3238|With just a touch of winter magic, it's really not that hard to bring a snowman to life. I don't know why more people don't do it!

// Hot Chocolate
3240|Mmm, sweet and toasty, with marshmallows! This not only warms your insides, but it also contains a massive dose of delicious iodine to clear out any radiation you're currently suffering from. Inexplicably it also charges up Geiger Counters when consumed. I can't explain that one.

// Tempered Axe Fragment
3242|This is a broken piece of an axe blade, tempered to polished steel! With enough of these, and a suitable source of enraged winter fury, you could forge an amazing icy axe blade.

// Icy Axe Blade
3244|This blade is enchanted with winter magic! You could build an awesome weapon with a pair of these and a handle... well, it'd be awesome if you could hold it. Maybe you need something to protect your hands when holding it.

// Steel Axe Handle
3246|This thing has a nice heft, and handy notches for inserting up to two axe blades. The only real downside is that it's made entirely of metal, so if you were to place, say, magical ice blades in it, the cold would be transmitted right to your hand, and you wouldn't be able to hold it.

// Grip Tape
3248|This is handy for wrapping around the handle of a weapon or tool. It can improve your grip, as well as protect you from cold metal handles.

// Riding Winter Wolf
3250|It's just like a horse... except soft and fuzzy!

// Weather Machine - Snowy Night
3252|Man, the weather outside is frightful! And dark!

// Elf Stockings
3254|This is really just long underwear. You probably should wear pants over them, but hey, Growtopia doesn't support that, so you'll just have to be cold!

// Sock On The Wall
3256|You need to wash your socks. This one stuck to the wall!

// Steam Gear
3258|This is a cog in a vast steam machine. Or it can be, if you build one, with this in it! This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power.

// Steam Tubes
3260|Tubes for directing steam power. This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. Steam flows straight when possible, otherwise it turns right (and turns left if it can't do that!).

3262|Steam power makes it go whump whump whump. This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power.

// Steam Lifter Piston

// Steam Riser Bellows
3268|Steam power makes it go eenk-oonk-eenk up and down (pardon the technical terminology). This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power.

3270|Jump on this to shoot steam below it! Use the other Steam Blocks to direct the steam where you need it.

// Growtopia Fan Shirt
3272|This amazing psychic shirt can actually display your thoughts with spectacular new morphing ink technology. Note: yeah, it just says the one thing, but you know you're thinking it.

// T-Shirt Cannon
3274|Powered by a Fuel Pack on your back, this gun can launch free T-shirts at your fellow Growtopians! Don't waste shots at anything else, it still burns fuel!

// Ghost Fan Shirt
3276|You like ghosts? No? Sure looks like you do.

// Pineapple Fan Shirt
3278|Who doesn't pineapple GT?

// Steam Valve
3280|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. If steam enters this block from the top or bottom, it will go out the bigger side, and the valve will flip for the next time.

// Steam Organ
3282|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. When steam passes through this block, it plays beautiful music! Use your wrench to adjust what note comes out.

// Steam Vent
3284|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. When steam passes through this block, it vents some out with intense heat! Do not touch this for 3 seconds after steam has been through.

// Steam Door
3286|Punch it to open or shut it. But even if you don't have access to do that, you can still open and shut it with steam power!

// Steampunk Corset
3288|Tired of always choosing the survival of your internal organs over looking skinny? The corset is the thing for you!

// Steampunk Skirt
3290|Multiple layers of petticoats keep you warm!

// Steampunk Top Hat
3292|Keep an extra pair of goggles up there. You never know when you'll need them.

// Steampunk Waistcoat
3294|The perfect garment for housing a pocketwatch, monocle, and perhaps taxidermy needles. Definitely some weird stuff in those pockets.

// Steampunk Leggings
3296|Works equally well for a steampunk or a pirate! Or maybe a dancer from the 80's.

// Steampunk Trenchcoat
3298|Keep warm on those frosty London evenings in this stylish piece by Grow Couture! Note: this is a "chest item", like a necklace, so you can wear any shirts and back items you want underneath it.

// Party Blaster
3300|Take the party with you every where you go!

// Tempered Party Tunes
3302|This is a highly polished bit of music. So shiny! Enough of these might be able to forge a relic from ancient times past...

// 80's Tape Deck
3304|Wow, this is some seriously old technology. It's no good without a suitable power source and some speakers to rock out of.

// D Battery
3306|A portable source of a tiny amount of power.

// Da Vinci Wings
3308|Da Vinci actually thought he could fly with these. He was totally wrong - they only let you double jump and glide.

// Steampunk Sprocket
3310|There's not a lot of difference between a sprocket and a gear. But this is a sprocket.

// Steampunk Gearbox
3312|It's a box full of sprockets and gears and whatnots! It's probably part of an awesome steampunk creation.

// Stretched Canvas
3314|It's not the prettiest decoration for your world, but it's probably got some other good uses.

// Silkworm
3316|A cute little pet for you to feed and care for! They'll eat almost anything, but don't forget to give them water too. Use your wrench to change your pet's name.

3554|This trainer's stepping on your turf. Take him down with your Battle Leash!

// Dark Cave Background
3556|This far-away dirt is speckled with shiny minerals. However, this dirt is in a dark cave (I don't care where you put it, IT IS IN A DARK CAVE!!). Players can only see what's on this tile if it's in their line of sight, or they have special tools.

// Spelunker's Headlamp
3574|This hardhat protects you from falling rocks, while the headlamp lights up dark caverns.

// Night Vision Goggles
3576|Equipping these lets you disregard darkness completely! If you're not in a world you own, they consume 1 D Battery for every minute you wear them. You can wear them without a battery if you just wanna look cool, though. Batteries not included.

// Hand Torch
3578|British people would call a Flashlight this, but this is an actual torch, for your hand. As opposed to an Adventure Item or wall torch. Carrying this lights up dark caves. Torches burn out at unpredictable moments, so carry several!

// Purple Cave Crystal
3580|These crystals grow naturally in caves. They don't actually glow - bioluminescent organisms feed on them and emit light. Also heat - be careful!

// Pineapple Hair
3624|This hair isn't made of pineapple, it's just been dyed and gelled to look like pineapple leaves.

3626|This hat says PT on it. You can wear it to show you're a Pet Trainer, but you could also use it to celebrate Physical Therapy, or Popcorn Time, or whatever you like!

3674|Whale whale whale, you'll really have to wail on this block to smash it. But you'll have a whale of a time doing it! And what a tail to tell it will be. I'm way ill from all these puns, I'm gonna start blubbering. ORCA.

// Pet Trainer Whistle
3676|You know how to battle a Pet Trainer, right? You just put your lips together, and blow this whistle. You might want to have a fully stocked Battle Leash first though, because Pet Trainers won't stay around waiting to fight you forever!

// Burnt Leather
3688|If this was a piece of a pig, you'd call it a pork rind. But it's a cow rind. Strong material for crafting!

// Buckle Design
3690|This paper details a method for forging a buckle out of Deep Iron. If you forge 100 Deep Iron Ingots with this design in hand, you'll make an Iron Buckle instead of a Pick Blade.

// Iron Buckle
3692|This buckle would be good for holding straps together, if you had a need for such things!

// Weather Machine - Heatwave
3694|This amazing new weather machine emits a vortex of howling flame, but if you wrench it, you'll find adjustable settings to control the color of the flames! You can only have one of these per world.

// B.O.O. Helmet
3712|The trouble with poltergeists is that they're always pushing things off of shelves (side note: cats pose the same problem). That's where the helmet comes in. Protect yourself from falling books and antiques!

// Neutron Pack
3714|This backpack contains a portable nuclear reactor. I know that sounds a bit unsafe, but... well, it is. It's a terrible idea. It has blinky lights, though. You'll need to wear a Neutron Pack to power a Neutron Gun.

// Neutron Gun
3716|This energy blaster looks impressive, but actually has no impact on our world. Rather, it creates a stream of neutrons that attracts spirits. Ghosts can't escape the beam. Which reminds me: Don't ever cross your beam with somebody else's! That would be bad.

// Rubber Boots
3718|These are tight-fitting boots made of a natural rubber that protects from slime while still allowing your feet to breathe.

// Ghost Jar
3720|Place this jar down and it will suck in a ghost that's above it. You will probably need some friends with Neutron Guns to keep the ghost contained or it will escape! A jar takes 2 seconds to activate, and then only collects spirits for 5 seconds, so time it carefully.

// Ghost-In-A-Jar
3722|Spooky! This jar contains a ghost! You can throw it to break the jar and unleash the ghost, or instead Drop it gently in front of a Spirit Storage Unit, where you can keep the ghost for good.

// Spirit Storage Unit
3724|This incredible machine was invented a hundred years ago, and still runs on Steam power! Drop Ghosts-In-A-Jar in front of it, then provide it with Steam power to store the ghosts. Warning: If you overload the device, it may explode!

// Destroyed Spirit Storage Unit
3726|An SSU that exploded. No good for anything now.

// Crystallized Ghost
3730|This ghost underwent some kind of reaction during a Spirit Storage explosion, and now it's been crystallized inside a solid block. Maybe one day scientists will extract its DNA and make a theme park of ghosts. Probably not, since ghosts don't have DNA.

// Warning Block
3732|When something is so dangerous there's no time for words, just throw down some yellow and black stripes!

// Warning Background
3734|When something is so dangerous there's no time for words, just throw down some yellow and black stripes!

// Firefin
3746|It's not too tough to figure out where this fish gets it's name. During the winter, they stay in warmer waters, but for the week of Summerfest, these can be found in their old spawning grounds right here in Growtopia!

// Bone Spikes
3748|Someone has staked a bunch of bones here and sharpened the ends. I know that's dangerous in itself, but aren't you a little more concerned about exactly who did it and where they are now?

// Ghost Charm
3750|When activated (punch to activate), this horrific face terrifies even ghosts, preventing new ghosts from appearing in your world. Ghosts that are already in your world still need to be captured by B.O.O. professionals, however. The poor ghosts are trapped on this earthly plane!

3752|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. Steam can enter this Funnel from 3 sides, but can only exit from one side. You figure out which!

3754|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. Steam can enter this Funnel from 3 sides, but can only exit from one side. You figure out which!

// Steam Lamp
3770|This crystal lamp is powered by steam! It burns for 10 seconds each time it gets charged. It can only be powered from below.

// Steam Spikes
3772|Steam forces razor-sharp spikes from the ground in this dastardly trap! It can only be powered from below. Power it again to lower the spikes.

3796|This block can only be moved through in the direction the arrow is pointing. From the other direction, it might as well be a wall!

// VIP Entrance
3798|The fanciest door in town! The only people getting through this door are the ones who are on The List. Wrench the door to add people to The List. Or remove them, if they have offended you in some way.

// Red Hair Dye

3890|This is just a blob of wool. Not too useful. Get 100 of these to weave a bolt together!

// Wool Bolt
3892|Sew wool items by using this in a sewing machine with silk bolts. It takes 3 bolts of silk or wool to craft an item.

3894|These special edition Air Robinsons are themed to celebrate the harvest, or just be bright crazy colors, like all basketball shoes.

// Silkworm Soul
3896|The great thing about silkworms is that they don't have unique souls. They're totally interchangeable! Jam this into any dead silkworm to bring it back for a 2nd chance.

// Telephone
3898|It's a phone! Dial it with your wrench. Growtopia doesn't have any cell service, so you're stuck with this old thing.

// Wooden Sword
3900|They use these to train in Kendo. They won't cut much, but getting whacked with one certainly does hurt!

// Crazy Jim
3902|not a real item, just for an icon in the telephone screen.

// Illuminati Stone
3916|Finally, 100% undeniable proof! You have DISCOVERED THE TRUTH!!

// Igneous Rock
3930|Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava.

// Rock Hammer
3932|A precision instrument for chipping fossils out of rocks. If you find a fossil, equip this hammer and start tapping - but do it *carefully!* If the fossil comes loose and you hit again, you'll break it!

// Rock Chisel
3934|So you've extracted a fossil from a rock, but the rock is still in your way. That's where the chisel comes in! It lets you chip away the rock without damaging the fossil.

// Fossil
3936|A corpse from millions of years ago, turned to stone. It's still covered with a lot of stone, so we're not sure what it is just yet. Try cleaning it off in a Fossil Prep Station.

// Fossil Prep Station
3938|Put a fossil in this tank where special solvents and bacterial agents will slowly dissolve any remaining rock and reveal exactly what you've found. The time required varies anywhere from an hour to a day depending on how much needs dissolving. The light turns green when it's ready, so punch to collect!

// Ammonite Block
3940|A huge beautiful ammonite fossil has been extracted! It'd make a lovely coffee table.

// Dino Ribcage
3942|It's a bit grisly, but these enormous bones make kind of a fun set of monkey bars...

// Dinosaur Mask
3944|This is how you would look if a dinosaur snuck up behind you and swallowed you, but you got stuck in his throat. It's really a bad situation for everyone involved.

// Ancient Plant Seed
3946|This seed from the ancient past is completely intact - there may still be some DNA inside! Plant DNA, but still that's exciting, right?

// Amber Block
3948|This ancient tree sap has hardened into a beautiful crystal. Who knows, there might even be a mosquito inside holding dinosaur DNA! That's pretty standard for amber.

// T-Rex Skull
3950|This would make an impressive display in your museum! Even more impressive in your haunted house.

// DNA Processor
4080|This advanced device from Growtech can take in strands of ancient DNA and combine them to create real living creatures. It has terrifying ethical implications.

// Dino DNA Strand A-273
4082|This is a strand of prehistoric DNA. All we know for sure is it came from a dinosaur. Perhaps there's a way to recombine it and bring them back! That doesn't seem like a terrible idea at all.

// Dino DNA Strand C-904

// Prehistoric Vines
4104|You can hide from rampaging dinosaurs in these vines.

// Prehistoric Candy Vines
4106|You can try to hide from rampaging dinosaurs in these vines, but you'll probably get eaten because the vines themselves taste like candy.

// Seussian Tree
4108|These particular trees, near the Jurassic seas, produced quite a crunchety fruit. Though scientists say that it tasted okay, we can't pollinate so it's moot.

// Flowersaurus Rex
4110|You monster, what fresh horror have you wrought?!!? Has science gone too far?

// Blue Riding Raptor

4124|This experimental device can extract prehistoric DNA from objects which contain even small traces. To give it a try, just use an item on it and see what you find! This is very new technology, so results are unpredictable, and rarely successful.

// Stone Spear
4126|In ancient times, sticks and stones were about as good as it got. The upside is it's a magic stone - this spear will teleport back into your hand once thrown!

// Blue Hardhat
4128|Head protection is required in construction areas, and at some dig sites.

// Outback Hat
4130|G'day! Barbie! Shrimp! That's not a knife, it's a hat! These hats are popular among paleontologists and other desert dwellers.

// Fossil Brush
4132|You can use this to gently brush a fossil before you pick it up, improving its quality. A Fossil Brush will be destroyed upon use (fossils are very rough until you brush them!). If you pick up a fossil, your finger oils will make a Fossil Brush useless, so be sure you brush before collecting!

// Polished Fossil
4134|This fossil has been carefully polished, so it's sure to yield something good when run through a Fossil Prep Station!

// Doompunk Leggings
4146|Works equally well for a doompunk or a pirate! Or maybe a serial killer from the 80's.

// Doompunk Trenchcoat
4148|Keep warm while stalking people on those frosty London evenings in this stylish piece by Grow Couture! Note: this is a "chest item", like a necklace, so you can wear any shirts and back items you want underneath it.

// Eye Of Growganoth
4150|This accursed necklace binds one of the eternal and innumerable Eyes of Growganoth to your service. Just make sure you don't take *your* eye off of it - at the first sign of weakness, it will devour your soul!

// Apocalypse Steed
4152|The four horsemen have updated to more modern steeds. They're probably gonna be pretty mad when they find out you swiped one.

// Jack o' Lantern Mask
4154|Luckily this is just latex and not actually a gooey carved-out pumpkin.

4156|Why you little devil...

4170|You know what a really good weapon is? A wagon wheel. Yeah, I mean... yeah.

// Demonic Skull
4172|Just the thing for showing your appreciation of the darker musicks.

// Death Metal Block
4174|Throw up the horns! METAL!!!!!

// Steel Spike
4176|Hey, these things have a million uses! I can't think of any right now, but they totally do. Just don't leave them inside surgical patients, please.

// Tempered Steel Spike
4178|This spike is so much shinier now! Classy enough to wear to the Halloween Ball.

// Spiked Collar
4180|Ah yeah, you look tough, like a junkyard dog.

// Malevolent Hair
4182|What are you up to under that mop-top? Seems like something a little sneaky...

// Riding Raven
4184|Only dark magic could breed a raven so massive. It's so powerful it allows you to double-jump!

// Haunted Darkness
4186|It's pitch black inside this haunted house! Players can only see what's on this tile if it's in their line of sight, or they have special tools.

// Haunted Window
4188|It's so dark in here, only the window provides any relief! Players can only see what's on this tile if it's in their line of sight, or they have special tools.

// Paper Wall
4198|This wallpaper is a paper wall.

// Stone Pagoda Roof Element
4200|Stick this at the ends of your pagoda roofs. It doesn't serve any functional purpose, but it sure looks nice. Just make sure you put it the right way or it'll be floating in midair.

// Decorative Roof Dragon
4202|Just for looks. Make your pagoda roofs spikey with dragons! Not so spikey they hurt, though.

// Grand Jade Platform
4204|Something stylish to stand on. Try decorating it with Decorative Roof Dragons!

// Stone Pagoda Base
4206|This is a special piece - it looks just like the bottom row of a Stone Pagoda, and it even tiles properly with Stone Pagoda blocks. The trick is, it won't tile with ones below it. Use it to put a roof in the middle of your pagoda! Kind of a key feature of pagodas, right? It will also tile with Decorative Roof Dragons.

// Demonic Horns
4208|Mahhtin looks like Tim Curry.

// Wooden Pagoda Door
4218|Like any door, you can wrench it to set the destination.

// Punched Tournament Ticket
4226|Your ticket has been punched! You can battle in the current Tournament as many times as you like. The ticket will self-destruct when the tournament ends. Don't lose it, or you can't battle anymore!

// Snack Fu
4228|Master Ping, Master Peng's brother, runs Snack Fu, providing delicious and exotic treats to everybody watching the tournament!

// Ramune
4230|This fizzy lemon-lime drink is sure to result in some major burps.

// Pow Stones
4232|This carbonated candy crackles and pops in your mouth. Don't worry, it's probably not made from real rocks. Warning: DO NOT COMBINE WITH SODA. Super duper true urban legends verify that this is dangerous.

// Minor Otherworldly Bait
4246|This is bait for fishing. Equip a fishing rod and then use this bait on water that you are standing next to in order to start fishing. This bait actually travels through a wormhole into a dark dimension and catches things there, instead of in the water. Minorly bad things.

// Lesser Otherworldly Bait
4248|This is bait for fishing. Equip a fishing rod and then use this bait on water that you are standing next to in order to start fishing. This bait actually travels through a wormhole into a dark dimension and catches things there, instead of in the water. Lesser bad things.

4250|Wanna be as COOL as Master Peng? Not gonna happen. But you can wear this mask and look like a dork.

// Z.D.F. Fence
4494|Let the zombies know what they're in for if they trample your fence! The Z.D.F. is ready to rumble!

// Bridle Design
4538|This paper details a method for forging a bridle out of Star Iron. If you forge 100 Star Iron Ingots with this design in hand, you'll make a Cosmic Bridle. This consumes the design.

// Star Iron
4540|This is raw ore, mined from the heart of a comet. Surely there's something you can do with it!
